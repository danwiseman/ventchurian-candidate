## The Dapper Raccoon :raccoon:

Just like our dapper raccoon, this Python project is here to add some style and sophistication to your vent control! :classical_building:

## Why Control the Airflow? :tornado:

Because, just like a raccoon's suit, the perfect temperature is all about the right fit! And who wants to be in a room that's too hot or too cold? Not our stylish raccoon, that's for sure! :thermometer:

## Features :bricks:
- Control your Flair vents like a pro :control_knobs:
- Set the perfect temperature :sun_with_face::partly_sunny_rain:
- Prevent any unexpected gusts of cold or hot air :wind_blowing_face:

## Installation :wrench:
Just like getting dressed up in a suit and tie, installation is a breeze!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danwiseman/ventchurian-candidate.git
cd flair-vent-controller
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Pun Fact: Why did the raccoon break up with his air conditioner? Because it was too cold and he needed some space! :heart_eyes_cat:
